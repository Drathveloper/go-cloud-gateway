// Settings configures CircuitBreaker:
//
// Name is the name of the CircuitBreaker.
//
// MaxRequests is the maximum number of requests allowed to pass through
// when the CircuitBreaker is half-open.
// If MaxRequests is 0, the CircuitBreaker allows only 1 request.
//
// Interval is the cyclic period of the closed state
// for the CircuitBreaker to clear the internal Counts.
// If Interval is less than or equal to 0, the CircuitBreaker doesn't clear internal Counts during the closed state.
//
// Timeout is the period of the open state,
// after which the state of the CircuitBreaker becomes half-open.
// If Timeout is less than or equal to 0, the timeout value of the CircuitBreaker is set to 60 seconds.
//
// ReadyToTrip is called with a copy of Counts whenever a request fails in the closed state.
// If ReadyToTrip returns true, the CircuitBreaker will be placed into the open state.
// If ReadyToTrip is nil, the default ReadyToTrip is used.
// Default ReadyToTrip returns true when the number of consecutive failures is more than 5.
//
// OnStateChange is called whenever the state of the CircuitBreaker changes.
//
// IsSuccessful is called with the error returned from a request.
// If IsSuccessful returns true, the error is counted as a success.
// Otherwise, the error is counted as a failure.
// If IsSuccessful is nil, default IsSuccessful is used, which returns false for all non-nil errors.
